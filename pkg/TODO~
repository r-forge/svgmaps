ToDo: 

- relations: make more then depth one possible
- implement spatialPolygonsDataFrame with fortify
- make a test for spDataTransform.R
- what to do with holes in polygons? maybe as extra variable, when hole=TRUE
- geo referenzsysteme ??
- replace merge with join?
- think about behaviour if list for nodes/ways/relations is empty
- change the functions in osmarDataTransform so that you don't allways pass the whole osmar object
- give aliases for svgmap() - arguments
- geom_density?
- problem: if for example the user wants the colour for the version of nodes and relations there is a conflict,
  because a node can have two version then. and what should be done?
- throw errors if variable is not in dataset
- because of the mixup from lines and polygons in ways, lines will be kept and plotted even if you just wanted the polygons; has to be fixed
- drop node id?
- allow the usage of a normal dataframe? why not... some things have to be given like geom, lon, lat, variable and value
- should it be allowed to pass more the one sp-object instead of a list of sp_objects?
