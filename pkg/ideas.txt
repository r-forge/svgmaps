#   Ideas for the svg- package

- Tooltips for the labels (x and y); could be an extra option; something like svg_map(..., xlab.hov="xlab description", ylab.hov="ylab description")

- maybe linking two plots

- make an own CSS Stylesheet for the appearance of the tooltips

- add more than one tooltip per point and choose between them with checkboxes

- use low-level functions of SVGAnnotation to get specific plot points (e.g. streets, rivers, signals, ...); instead of getPlotPoints() getRivers(), getStreets()

- animation for time series. -> every osmar object has a time stamp

- checkboxes for adding and removing layers. a layer could be for example streets or buildings. 
  layers could also be points like shops

- types of stats: 
    - nodes: - plot nodes and annotate them depending on one variable (+ color)
             - count nodes in a rectengular and color the rect
	     - count nodes in a way and color way (or make the line thicker)
    - ways:  - count ways in a rectangular and color it (count)
             - plot ways and annotate them, depending on one variable (+ color)
    - rels: 

- before casting merging and all that stuff, filter the data; just keep the information which is going to be plotted

- different units: 
  - nodes: makes stats only on single notes osm_obj$nodes$attrs$id
  - ways: make stats for ways (e.g. how many shops does a street have?) osm_obj$ways$attrs$id
    	  make stats for areas, which is a special way (maybe with subset?)
  - rects: make stats for rects like in thomas ba thesis (example with signals) make a grid and aggregate points
  - rels: one stat per rel osm_obj$relations$attrs$id

- one function for drawing + wrapper for this function for specific purposes

- automatically open browser and update plot

- use the OpenStreetMap package for background? this would be very cool!

- option to produce graphics in an other format than SVG (without interactivity of course)

- legend with color key; maybe interactive. when you click on a unit an arrow points to the value on the key.
  second click: alpha = 0.5 for the old click and new click gets an arrow

- minor problem: what to do with sp-objects?  there is less data in them. 
  units can be the same: points, lines, polygons and grid. 
  but what to do with the stats? maybe i could add an option for additional data. 
  depending on the units, the ids have to match

- maybe use gridSVG instead of SVGAnnotation

- what to do with multipolygons (osmar)? http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Relation:multipolygon

- package ggmap: take a closer look at this package!

- there is a SpatialGridDataFrame-object in sp
