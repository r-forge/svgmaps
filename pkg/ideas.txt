#   Ideas for the svg- package

- Tooltips for the labels (x and y); could be an extra option; something like svg_map(..., xlab.hov="xlab description", ylab.hov="ylab description")

- make an own CSS Stylesheet for the appearance of the tooltips

- add more than one tooltip per point and choose between them with checkboxes

- animation for time series. -> every osmar object has a time stamp

- checkboxes for adding and removing layers. a layer could be for example streets or buildings. 
  layers could also be points like shops


- automatically open browser and update plot

- use the OpenStreetMap package for background? this would be great!

- option to produce graphics in an other format than SVG (without interactivity of course)

- legend with color key; maybe interactive. when you click on a unit an arrow points to the value on the key.
  second click: alpha = 0.5 for the old click and new click gets an arrow

- maybe use gridSVG instead of SVGAnnotation

- what to do with multipolygons (osmar)? http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Relation:multipolygon

- package ggmap: take a closer look at this package!
