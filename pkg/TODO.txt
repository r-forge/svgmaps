ToDo: 

major importance
- think of possible examples besides the signal example
- implement highlighting (main part: find/write highlight-function with javascript)
- implement scale for var -> colour of highlighting (use SVG grids build in converter for colours)
- implement link
- SpatialGridDataFrame has two storage modes, make sure both work 
- comment svgmaps.R @home
- suppress GUI device in ggplot2SVG @home
- make a test for sp-transform.R @home
- either allow wide format for svgmaps data.frame or find a way to cast within gplot2
  for this find out how the data is searched if the geom has no extra df; 
  this is in plot-build.r 

minor importance
- little textparser which changes \n to <br /> for tooltip
- geo referenzsysteme 
- drop node id? u dont need it
- add geom_imap
- make it possible to set specific values for interactivity (i.e. set tooltip outside aes())
- what is the problem with gridSVG and the ggplot background lines?
- find out how a geom should be done (ggplot2 google group question)
- improve/find better tooltip javascript
- change lon to long
