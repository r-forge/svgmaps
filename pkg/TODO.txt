ToDo: 

major importance
- signal example: take Stadtteil-polygons and count signals in it with sp_over
- implement scale for var -> colour of highlight_colour (use SVG grids build in converter for colours)
- SpatialGridDataFrame has two storage modes, make sure both work 
- Convertion of SpatialGrid to SpatialPixels in as_svgmaps.SpatialGridDataFrame
- comment svgmaps.R @home
- suppress GUI device in ggplot2SVG @home
- make a test for sp-transform.R @home
- set default aesthetics
- fix empty link bug
- fix problem in add_keys
- add-interactivity: escape all unallowed sequences
- write hopts; should be easy: write hopts which does the same as opts; write +.svgmaps which writes out javascript vars from hopts and then calls ggplot(); set default hopts; if no hopts specified also defaults; (hsize, hcolour, hborder, ttcolour, link_type
- rewrite link and tooltip js with jQuery
- rewrite save_svgmap (kinda ugly right now)
- fix view_svgmap (does not always work)


minor importance
- implement dynamic aesthetic or something like that
- little textparser which changes \n to <br /> for tooltip
- or better: a generice r2Html- function (.lm, .data.frame, ...) which converts it into html
- geo referenzsysteme 
- drop node id? u dont need it
- what is the problem with gridSVG and the ggplot background lines?
- change lon to long
- write function add_relation: input osmar and var; adds var to attrs data frame of ways and nodes; relation.var
- improve link
