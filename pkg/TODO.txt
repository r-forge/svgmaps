ToDo: 

major importance
- SpatialGridDataFrame has two storage modes, make sure both work 
- Convertion of SpatialGrid to SpatialPixels in as_svgmaps.SpatialGridDataFrame
- make a test for sp-transform.R @home
- add to iopts: hsize, hborder, ttcolour, link_type
- add rects to highlighting
- rewrite tooltip js with jQuery: problem solving: reduce svg to minimal example (tooltip.js, jquery.full, qtip.full, and one element)
- fix view_svgmap (does not always work)
- comment everything
- interface in JSON and not ugly javascript code generation


minor importance
- suppress GUI device in ggplot2SVG @home
- implement dynamic aesthetic or something like that
- little textparser which changes \n to <br /> for tooltip
  or better: a generice r2Html- function (.lm, .data.frame, ...) which converts it into html
- geo referenzsysteme 
- drop node id? u dont need it
- what is the problem with gridSVG and the ggplot background lines?
- write function add_relation: input osmar and var; adds var to attrs data frame of ways and nodes; relation.var
