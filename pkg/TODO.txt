- Convertion of SpatialGrid to SpatialPixels in as_svgmaps.SpatialGridDataFrame
- make a test for sp-transform.R @home

- add rects to highlighting
- rewrite link and tooltip js with jQuery

minor importance
- suppress GUI device in ggplot2SVG @home
- implement dynamic aesthetic or something like that
- little textparser which changes \n to <br /> for tooltip

- geo referenzsysteme 
- drop node id? u dont need it
- what is the problem with gridSVG and the ggplot background lines?
