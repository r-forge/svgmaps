ToDo: 

- relations: make more then depth one possible
- make a test for spDataTransform.R
- what to do with holes in polygons? maybe as extra variable, when hole=TRUE
- geo referenzsysteme ??
- think about behaviour if list for nodes/ways/relations is empty
- give aliases for svgmap() - arguments
- geom_density?
- problem: if for example the user wants the colour for the version of nodes and relations there is a conflict,
  because a node can have two version then. and what should be done?
- throw errors if variable is not in dataset
- drop node id?
- allow the usage of a normal dataframe? why not... some things have to be given like geom, lon, lat, variable and value
- should it be allowed to pass more the one sp-object instead of a list of sp_objects?
- problem: path drawn with polylines so only one meta possible; one solution: make a for loop 
	to draw every path extra - UPDATE: there is an id in a polylinesgrob; maybe this could be used
